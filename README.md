# Tax calculator
Utility to count tax on income from foreign economic activity (I'm going to use it once a quarter). It should request NBU official exchange rate of hryvnia to foreign currencies.

## Prerequisites
Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Build
For initial project setup(or if you `node_modules/` folder is missing) you should run:
```
npm install
```
***
Then you can build the project with the following command:   
```
npm run build
```
Static files should be generated in the `dist/` folder  
***
You can also start a dev server:
```
npm run start
```
The result should accessible at http://localhost:8080/
